## Introducing Owly

Every awesome company needs a mascot, such as Android's Android, Clippy the Paperclip, Github's Octocat, Linux's penguin Tux and Ember JS's Tomster. And with them in mind we created the fun lovin', coffee drinking hipster that is Owly!

We had loads of fun designing him with all kinds of accessories, like hats, bubble pipes and even a strongman mustache, which we're sure you will get to see in the future, but for now we're happy to say we have found our owl.
